# CPC357-IoT-Project Smart Agriculture
This project is built to facilitate farmers, particularly paddy farmers to automate irrigation system and to wisely plan when to plant and harvest paddy according to weather forecast feature. Why paddy? Malaysia has been facing problem with shortage supply of rice due to several factors, mainly extreme weather conditions. This project aims to tackle this problem by providing weather forecast feature, automated irrigation system based on sensor data and bird pest control system.
This project involves hardware components like:
  1. DHT11 - To monitor temperature and humidity of the environment
  2. Moisture sensor - To measure the moisture level of soil
  3. Rain sensor - To measure the presence of rain
  4. Ultrasonic sensor - To measure the water depth of paddy field
  5. PIR sensor - To detect pest within paddy field area
  6. Water pump - To demonstrate irrigation system
  7. Buzzer/Phone speaker - To send bird or pest away with noise
